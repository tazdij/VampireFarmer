# VampireFarmer

## Game Idea

You are a Vampire who farms. You farm things vampires would want, such
as succulant Human Body Parts. In the game there should be your farm 
house, your farming plot, the town with a seed shop, and maybe if time
permits a market

## GOAL

I have no idea what the end game is yet. So far, just a creepy farming
game with some hopefully humorous dialog.

## TODO

* Create Art for 1 crops
* Create Farm Plot Layer (still need to render the actual crop)

* Create a few more ground tiles

* Start on character control
* Camera move with character
